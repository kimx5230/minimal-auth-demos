# Various "minimal" authentication demos

A mono-repo of several minimal authentication demos. The rationale for this is to provide a jump-start for devs or teams who need to try out, learn, or pick solutions with the least amount of effort possible.

When I write "minimal", I really mean the smallest amount of code that I can muster (or adapt from official examples), either by writing it myself or repurposing provider-made samples. By removing as much boilerplate, commentary and framework-specific junk as possible, I hope that going from public to private apps will be a lot less painful.

Demos for:

- [Magic.link](https://magic.link)
- [Auth0](https://auth0.com)
- [AWS Cognito](https://aws.amazon.com/cognito/)
- [GCP Identity-Aware Proxy](https://cloud.google.com/iap)
- [Firebase authentication](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth)

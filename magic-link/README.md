# Magic.link auth demo

Get a free account at Magic.link and set your basic settings as you wish. If you want to use social providers (Google, GitHub, Facebook), you have access to convenient links that direct you to the respective relevant resources.

Copy your testing API key and insert it into the code sample. The `index.html` file should be able to be run locally without any web server.

The code sample is adapted from Magic.link.

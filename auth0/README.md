# Auth0 auth demo

Use something like [Web Server for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/web-server-for-chrome/ofhbbkphhbklhfoeikjpcbhemlocgigb) or some other minimal means of running the code locally.

Get a free account at [Auth0](https://auth0.com) and set it up to your settings. Add domain and client ID to `auth_config.json`. Make sure to put your local development URL in `Allowed Callback URLs`.
